## Lab 1 -  Create a Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM)
Every Jupyter Notebook needs to be hosted, either locally, or in Azure. In Azure you can use a shared service, or host your notebooks on your own VM.<br>
In this lab - for better performance - you are going to create a DSVM.<br><br>

1. Navigate to the Azure portal and create a new Data Science VM for Linux (Ubuntu), with any instance details of your liking:<br>

)<br><br>
This image contains JupyterHub and opens the required ports upon creation.
While the VM is being deployed, proceed to the next lab.
